#   ALX Project Nexus 

##         Project Objective

This repository documents key backend engineering learnings from the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program. It highlights major concepts, technologies, tools, challenges, and best practices encountered throughout the course.

---

##          Key Technologies Learned

* **Python** - Core programming logic, async support
* **Django & Django REST Framework** - API development, authentication, permissions
* **GraphQL** - Flexible query APIs using `graphene-django`
* **Docker** - Containerization for development and deployment
* **CI/CD** - Automation with GitHub Actions, DockerHub
* **Celery & RabbitMQ** - Background tasks and message queues

---

##   Core Backend Concepts

* **RESTful API Design**: CRUD operations, status codes, views, serializers, routers
* **GraphQL APIs**: Queries, mutations, schemas, filters
* **Asynchronous Programming**: Using `async` & `await`, and Celery for background tasks
* **Database Design**: Modeling with Django ORM, migrations, relationships
* **Caching Strategies**: Redis, query optimization
* **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, session-based, role-based access control
* **System Design Basics**: Scalability, microservices thinking, API gateways

---

##  Real-World Challenges Faced

* **Challenge**: Handling bulk inserts from CSV with validations
  **Solution**: Used `Django management commands` + custom serializers

* **Challenge**: Protecting endpoints for specific user roles
  **Solution**: Created custom `permissions.py` and added logic to `viewsets`

* **Challenge**: Running background notifications on message creation
  **Solution**: Used Django signals + Celery tasks triggered on `post_save`

---

## Best Practices Learned

* Use of `serializers.py` to validate and handle complex nested data
* Modular app structure (`models`, `views`, `urls`, `permissions`)
* Writing unit tests for API endpoints using Django’s `TestCase`
* Secure environment variables with `.env` and `python-decouple`
* Proper logging and error handling with `logging` module

---

## Collaboration Highlights

* Paired with frontend learners to integrate our REST & GraphQL APIs
* Exposed endpoints for:

  * `/api/products/`
  * `/graphql`
  * `/api/orders/`
* Shared API documentation via Swagger UI and Postman collections

---

## Personal Takeaways

* Developed deep understanding of how real-world backend systems function
* Improved communication and collaboration through Discord , GitHub and even on whatsapp groups 
* Gained confidence building APIs, debugging, and deploying to cloud services
